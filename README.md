# Dork Gen
A simple dork generator written in python that outputs dorks with the domain extensions you enter in a ".txt file". 

## Usage

The code is pretty self-explanatory, just in case you still need help understanding it, I've commented the code.
In "dlist.py" are the dorks and in "dork.py" the "main" code. When using the generator, the "dork.py" file must be executed.
